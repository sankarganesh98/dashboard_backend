Dashboard Backend in Django
This repository hosts the backend code for a comprehensive and scalable dashboard built using Django. The backend is designed to support robust data handling, authentication, and server-side logic for a frontend dashboard application.

Features
RESTful API: Implements a RESTful API for efficient communication between the frontend and the backend, facilitating data retrieval, manipulation, and persistent storage.
Database Integration: Utilizes Django's ORM to integrate with relational databases such as PostgreSQL to manage and query data effectively.
Authentication and Authorization: Supports secure user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system and Django REST Framework's capabilities to manage access controls.
Admin Panel: Leverages Django's dynamic admin panel for an enhanced administrative interface where non-technical users can manage application data.
Asynchronous Tasks: Configures Celery with Django to handle background tasks like sending emails or processing data outside of the request/response cycle.
Error Handling: Implements comprehensive error handling to manage and log errors, enhancing the maintainability and robustness of the application.
Security Best Practices: Adheres to security best practices, including proper handling of user input, secure storage of sensitive information, and protection against common threats like SQL injection and CSRF attacks.
Technologies Used
Django: Utilizes Django for its powerful and extensible architecture which supports rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Django REST Framework: Employs Django REST Framework for building a clean and powerful RESTful API.
PostgreSQL: Uses PostgreSQL as the primary data store, chosen for its robustness, scalability, and strong community support.
Celery: Integrates Celery for handling asynchronous task queues.
Redis: Utilizes Redis as a message broker for Celery and caching mechanisms to enhance performance.
